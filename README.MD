# Chatbot using NLTK, Tensorflow and Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is made to build web applications synchronously using HTTP and enables you to trigger realtime notifications from your synchronous Python Web stack since it comes with a HTTP Pusher service. 

Chatbots have the potential to simplify and automate many existing tasks and to implement this Chatbot, we are using Python Deep Learning Neural Networks and NLTK (Natural Language Processing API) to process train and test text data.

> This Web Application was developed on Windows Operating System.
